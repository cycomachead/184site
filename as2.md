# RAYTRACER

### So, yeah... being busy sucks. :(

So, at the time of my submission my raytracer correctly handles everything 
EXCEPT transformations (no rotations, scales, or translations).

Basically, I spent my time before the midterm prepping for a conference demo, 
then a week at a conference, and then had a midterm. So, yeah, this trace could
have used a bit more love... BUT I plan on doing extra credit in a week or so.

So, on to the images. I'm simply linking the files I submitted.
